Testing https://www.yavlena.com/ site

To setup your environment you need following prerequisites:

 - installed java 17
 - maven installed 
 - git installed
 - suitable editor but this is optional (in my case IntelliJ)
 - you have to clone the public repo from github - https://github.com/valyo-nikolov/kinkarta
 - open the project in the editor
 - refresh your maven local repo with all dependencies and run the testng.xml suite or directly execute the YavlenaTest class.
